# jammer.css

A CSS framework designed to be as lightweight as possible while being a complete tool for the developing of PWAs.

The principles behind it are:

- tidy markup: one html tag does one thing, period. I hate having to add 3-5 tags around an element just for a pointless graphic effect
- as slim as possible: everything is in a css file < 50kb, withouth icon libraries or other side stuff. You link a file and are ready to go
- plug in and go: whenever you have to start a new project, you link jammer.min.css and you have got a general page structure, a lot of default styling and a lot of prestyled components, saving a lot of time down the road
- modern: it makes use of the most recent css implementations in a reasonable way

## Getting Started

Once you've downloaded the package open example.html for a rundown of the components this framework gives you.

### Installing

It's just one CSS file that you can link in your project as usual
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jammer.min.css">
```
